# Weather App
## Description
This is yet another basic react weather app using Open Weather Map's free API. 
This is meant to be a learning project to teach myself typescript and vite.

This is not a production app!

### Tech Stack

    Language: Typescript
    Framework: React
    Styling: SCSS
    Dev Tools: Vite, VS Code

### Getting Started

To use this app you will need an API key for open weather map. Once you have this you can add it to a .env file in the root directory of the project.
The file should have something like this `VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY: [Your API Key Here]`
